Facial Recognition 
In the application you will also able to find the option of facial recognition where you can mark the attendance just by looking into the camera.
How it works?
When we press the button, it accesses the pc camera and you will only have to look for some couple of seconds and it will take your image and recognize it and it will return an ID and based on that ID we will extract the record from the main student database and it will get stored in the attendance database along with timestamp. If image will find it will return a notification that attendance marked else it will throw an error that record not found.
